This is a generic template SBN module with all of the boilerplate code, error 
checking, and doxygen documentation necessary to have a mostly-working module.

To create a new module from this template, copy the module_template folder, name
it what you want to name your module, and then do a find/replace on everything
for "template" and "TEMPLATE", replacing those with your module's name. Make
sure that the app.cfg file and the Makefile for your module are correct.

In various functions in TEMPLATE_sbn_if.c, there are TODOs marked where you can
put your module-specific code. You can use the other modules as examples. 

Once you have finished your module, update the doxygen source file with your
module's information.
