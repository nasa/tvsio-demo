The C\-F\-S S\-B\-N application provides inter-\/processor communication by routing software bus messages over a variety of network infrastructures. The S\-B\-N application is transparent to other C\-F\-S applications and requires no changes to existing applications. S\-B\-N requires little compile-\/time or start-\/time configuration, subscriptions are automatically discovered and communicated to peer processors.
