******** protobetter serialization library ***********
******************************************************

This library uses *.ptype files defining an application-agnostic message structure and generates C-API functions which can serialize c-structs with the corresponding message structure.


"proto_type" files (extension "*.ptype") are files containing json arrays which define the structure of messages to be consumed/produced by the calling applications.  Example *.ptype files can be found in the test/ directory.


To run the protobetter compiler on a set of *.ptype files, execute:

'python protobetter_compiler.py <path_to_ptype_files>'
(hint: use '-h' or '--help' for other options)

Only dependencies are protobetter_core.h as well as a single generated header/source file pair.
